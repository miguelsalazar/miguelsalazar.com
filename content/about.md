# About

I’m a software engineer passionate about building scalable and distributed products. I’ve worked in the tech industry for multinational companies, startups, and non-profits. I’ve also been a lecturer at my local university.

My main areas of interest are distributed systems, machine learning, cryptonetworks.

Outside of work, I practice Brazilian jiu-jitsu and muay thai. I also play the guitar, some harmonica, and I’m starting to learn how to play drums. My goal is to become a one-man band. I enjoy hiking and trail running and hit the trails whenever I have a chance, which is less frequent nowadays.

I created this space to document and share my random streams of consciousness (however raw and unpolished they could be) as well tiny projects that I build.
